# Theorem 3: DDH Security Implies CKA Security

Theorem 3 from Alwen-Coretti-Dodis (2020), Section 4.1.2, page 22.

**Statement**: If group G is (t,ε)-DDH-secure, then the DDH-based CKA scheme
is (t,Δ,ε)-secure for t ≈ t' and Δ = 1.

## Proof idea (reduction)

Given a CKA adversary `A` that distinguishes real from random CKA output,
construct a DDH adversary `B` as follows:

- `B` receives `(g, a • g, b • g, c • g)` from the DDH challenger
- `B` interprets `a • g` as the peer's public key `h` (from `init` with `k = a`)
- `B` interprets `b • g` as the CKA message `T` (from `send` with `x = b`)
- `B` interprets `c • g` as the candidate output `I`
- `B` feeds `(T, I) = (b • g, c • g)` to the CKA adversary `A`

If `c = a * b` (real DDH triple), then `c • g = (a * b) • g = b • (a • g) = b • h`,
which is the genuine CKA output. If `c` is random, then `c • g` is random.
So `B`'s DDH advantage equals `A`'s CKA advantage.

## Why `F`, `Module F G`, and `Function.Bijective (· • g)`?

A cyclic group G of order n with generator g is abstractly ℤ/nℤ acting on G
by repeated addition: `k • g = g + g + ⋯ + g` (k times). The group G is
naturally a ℤ-module, but the action `(· • g : ℤ → G)` is NOT injective
(k and k + n give the same element).

In cryptography, we work with prime-order groups: n = p is prime, so ℤ/pℤ
is a field. That field is `F`. The type-class `[Module F G]` says "F acts on
G by scalar multiplication". The hypothesis

    `hg : Function.Bijective (· • g : F → G)`

encodes BOTH:
- **Surjectivity**: g generates all of G (every element is a • g for some a)
- **Injectivity**: |F| = |G| and g has trivial stabilizer

Together these say G ≅ F as an F-module via `a ↦ a • g`, which is exactly
"G = ⟨g⟩ is a cyclic group of prime order |F|."

This hypothesis is needed for `ckaRandExp_eq_ddhExpRand`: the CKA random game
samples uniformly from G, while the DDH random game samples `c ← F` and
computes `c • g`. These are the same distribution iff `(· • g)` is bijective.

The DDH adversary ignores `g` and `a • g` (the setup), and feeds

CKA real: sample `k ← F`, `x ← F`, adversary sees `(x • g, x • (k • g))`.
DDH real: sample `a ← F`, `b ← F`, adversary sees `(b • g, (a * b) • g)`.
These are identical (with `k = a`, `x = b` and using `smul_smul`). -/

Requires `hg : Function.Bijective (· • g)` (i.e., g generates G): the CKA
random game samples uniformly from `G` via `$ᵗ G`, while the DDH random game
samples `c ← $ᵗ F` and computes `c • g`. These distributions coincide iff
`(· • g : F → G)` is bijective. -/

/-- **Theorem 3** (Alwen-Coretti-Dodis 2020), concrete per-adversary form:

For every CKA adversary `A`, its advantage against the DDH-CKA scheme is
bounded by the DDH advantage of the reduced adversary `ckaAdvToDDHAdv A`.

The hypothesis `hg` formalizes "G = ⟨g⟩ is cyclic of prime order |F|".
See the module docstring for why this is needed and how it relates to the
standard mathematical definition of a cyclic group. -/

"Assume group G is (t,ε)-DDH-secure. Then the above CKA scheme CKA is

This is the paper's exact claim, minus the runtime parameter t.
It follows from `ddh_implies_cka_security` by instantiation: if every
DDH adversary has advantage ≤ ε, then for any CKA adversary A,
  `ckaDistAdvantage ... A ≤ ddhDistAdvantage ... (ckaAdvToDDHAdv A) ≤ ε` -/

/-- **Theorem 3** (paper-faithful, multi-epoch with Δ=1):

"Assume group G of prime order p is (t,ε)-DDH-secure. Then the above CKA
scheme CKA is (t, Δ, ε)-secure for t ≈ t' and Δ = 1."

This uses the multi-epoch game from Figure 3 with healing parameter Δ=1.
Δ=1 means one fresh DH exchange after the challenge epoch suffices to make
the state independent of the challenged key: the new sender picks fresh
`x ← F` and computes `x • g`, which is independent of the challenged output.

Proved via reduction: any multi-epoch CKA adversary can be converted to a
DDH adversary with the same advantage, by embedding the DDH challenge at
epoch `t*` and simulating all other epochs honestly (the reduction knows
the shared key from init and can run CKA-S/CKA-R for non-challenge epochs). -/

If G is (t,ε)-DDH-secure, then the DDH-based CKA scheme is (t, Δ=1, ε)-secure
in the full Figure 3 game with adaptive oracle interaction, party-specific
corruption, and bad-randomness oracles.

This is the paper-faithful statement over the upgraded game model. The proof
(when filled in) embeds the DDH challenge at epoch `t*` and simulates all
other epochs honestly. -/
